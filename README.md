## Background
Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats to urban populations and while all people are exposed, pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability vary across neighborhoods. Exposures to common air pollutants have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. These indicators provide a perspective across time and NYC geographies to better characterize air quality and health in NYC.



## About the dataset

The data can be downloaded from this link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality.

We are interested in a data set about the air quality about New York City. In this data set, there is a Name variable which represents the different air quality indicators, like PM2.5, NO2, etc. The variable Measure indicates the type of measurement for air quality, such as “mean”. Time period variable is about the corresponding validate time period for the data set measurements. Geo place name indicates the different places where the measurements have been taken. 

First, we are interested in the trend analysis of air quality over time in the whole NY City. To be specific, we plan to see the change of different indicators over time in NY.

* Overall Trend: There is a general decreasing trend in NO2 concentration over the years. The concentration starts at around 23 parts per billion (ppb) in 2009 and decreases to just below 15 ppb by 2021.

* Yearly Changes: The largest drop appears to occur between 2009 and 2011. After 2011, the decreases are less steep but consistent, with some years showing slight increases or stability before continuing to decline.

Second, we would compare different indicators (probably through proportions) at a certain time period (average across a year) in a specific location. 

Third, we want to see if there is any correlation between different types of air pollutions (indicators) at NY across a given year.
